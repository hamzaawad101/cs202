3.In your own words, what is the benefit of a recursive solution to
A recursive solution is good for enumerating all potential solutions and simplifies 
the process of trying different queen placment.Each call is attempting to place a queen and 
then backtracking.
4. Also in your own words, what are the theoretical and/or practical
advantages of constraining the search space to only still valid 
solutions? By constraining the search space to only still valid 
solutions we reduce the number of recursive calls and by skipping 
invaild queen placement early on.
